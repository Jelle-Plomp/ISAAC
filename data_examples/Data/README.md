# Example data
This is the data as outputted after performing ISAAC and saving HFR data.

With the files ending with _infoPreM.mat_ and _PreM_ImageData.bin_, a video can be created of the iterative procedure.

The RcvData (RF-data) was reduced here to only include 10 frames of the total of 1000 frames. It can be reconstructed using part B of the repository.
